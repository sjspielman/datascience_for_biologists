## Introduction to RMarkdown

This is an **RMarkdown** document. R is a computer language, and markdown is a simple formatting syntax, known as a "markup language" (groan puns groan, buckle up), for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents within plain-text environments. **RMarkdown is a unified framework for integrating markdown formatted-text with R code. It is the best.**

RMarkdown documents begin with a section known as _YAML front matter_ ("YAML" = "YAML ain't markup language". This is known as recursive acronym. Welcome to the wide world of "Programmers Attempt Naming Humor."). The front matter, whose contents are bounded by three dashes `---` before and after, specifies document settings including information for how the document should be _rendered_ into its final product, as well as any other parameters that are used throughout the RMarkdown file. 

As indicated in the YAML front matter, this document will produce an HTML file when you click the **Knit** button (a package called `knitr` will show up and created your beautiful HTML). The _syntax_ (code coloring) will be highlighted according to the "tango" scheme (we'll come back to this later!).


## Resources

Your resources for working with RMarkdown include:

1. [RStudio Rmarkdown documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
2. [RMarkdown Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
3. [The definitive RMarkdown reference](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) by the inventor of RMarkdown, Yihui Xie, a very badass RStudio Engineer who also gives hilarious talks. This book is _incredibly comprehensive_, beware.
    + [Here is](https://yihui.org/en/2018/03/blogdown-video-rstudio-conf/) a talk he gave last year on a new R package `bookdown`, which uses RMarkdown to make E-books and more (as in, every single online book in this class was made using `bookdown`).

## Briefly, markdown syntax

Below are LIMITED examples of writing markdown documents. For a comprehensive set of ways to customize your documents, see [the official basic syntax](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) 

We can write headers of varying size with different numbers of hashtags (remember, this is NOT R code - these are not comments!).

# Biggest header
## Slightly smaller
### And smaller
#### And smaller!!!
##### so smol
###### this is the smolest

We can also make bulleted lists, as shown below. There always needs to be a new line before the start of a list, otherwise it will NOT render properly. (See this for yourself by deleting the next new line and knitting. No more bullets :( )

+ __bold text__ and **bold text**
+ _italics text_ and *italics text*
+ `code formatted text`, but this is NOT actual code!!
  + A nested list item is tabbed in
* We can also use stars for bullets
- And dashes too

> This is known as a blockquote. It's sometimes useful.

Any HTML component will also work in a markdown document. If you know HTML, style it up as you wish. If you don't know HTML, you're probably a happier person.

One important HTML bit to know, however, are comments. _HTML comments_ are which are enclosed with `<!--` and `-->`. When you click **Knit**, the engine will ignore these bits - they are comments! Regular R-style comments won't work in markdown - in markdown, R comments are headers.
<!-- You will NOT SEE this sentence appear in the knitted document because it is enclosed in a comment structure. -->

## Working with code chunks

Below is an _R code chunk_, which RStudio has kindly shaded in grey for easier visibility.

```{r}
## This is a code chunk.
head(iris)
```

There are several ways you can modify the behavior of code chunks, by adding arguments inside the `{r}` part at the beginning.

0. The `{r}` itself means "This is R code." It is possible, in fact, to specify _other languages(!)_ rather than R, for example you can run bash code within RMarkdown documents by writing `{bash}` instead. __This is beyond the scope of our class.__ We will only be writing R code here!

1. You can name a chunk by adding a name like `{r, code-chunk-name}`.

2. There are several parameters which you can include that modify how the `knitr` engine deals with the code chunk, some of which are described below. Each parameter should be set to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. These defaults are implicitly applied if you don't specify:
    + `include=TRUE`: Should this code chunk itself be __included__ in the final output. `include=FALSE` means the code will still be run but the knitted document will NOT show the code or its output. 
    + `echo=TRUE`: Should the __output__ from the code be displayed in the knitted document?
    + `eval=TRUE`: Should we even run this code chunk? If `FALSE`, the code chunk will appear as code but it won't have been run, so it also won't have any output.
    + `warnings=TRUE`: If the code produces any warning messages, should they be displayed in the knitted document?
    + `messages=TRUE`: If the code produces any general messages, should they be displayed in the knitted document?
    + `error=FALSE`: If the code is broken and gives errors, the default behavior (`FALSE`) is to halt knitting entirely until the user fixes the bug. To allow knitting to proceed and show the error message, set `error=TRUE`
    + `collapse=FALSE`: If `FALSE`, the code output will be displayed in a separate white box from the code itself. If `TRUE`, output will be embedded into the code itself.

#### <mark>EXERCISE SET ONE</mark>

Practice writing code chunks in the space below. After you write each chunk, make sure it works as expected by pressing the **green arrow** at the top-right corner of the chunk. This will **Run** your code chunk and reveal its output in place, without going through the hassle of knitting the entire document. You can clear this output by clicking the "x" in its top right corner. You are also welcome to Knit each time if that works for you! 

> Beware: Pressing the green arrow doesn't always mean the code was run in the Console. If/when you encouter errors that suggest the code you thought you ran didn't run, it's because the code was run..elsewhere.


1. Write a code chunk named "chunk-1" that reveals the _last six rows_ (hint: use the function `tail()`) of the `iris` data frame. 

```{r}
```

2. Write a code chunk named "chunk-2" that calculates the maximum value of iris sepal lengths (hint: remember the function `max()` and the `$` for working with columns). In your chunk, set the option `collapse=TRUE` to see how output looks different.

```{r}
```

3. Write a code chunk named "chunk-3" that makes a _histogram_ of iris petal widths. Be sure to style your plot appropriately with clean labels. Execute this code chunk with and without the added parameter `messages=FALSE`. What difference do you see?

```{r}
```

4. Write a code chunk named "chunk-4" that makes a _scatterplot_ of iris petal widths across petal lengths, where points are colored according their sepal widths. Be sure to style your plot appropriately with clean labels. 

 
    ```{r}
    ```
  
    + For an added challenge, change the _color palette_ to your liking with the function [`scale_color_gradient()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_gradient.html)
    + For an added-added challenge, change the color palette using one of the "Brewer" palettes. You will need to use the function [`scale_color_distiller()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html) for this. To accomplish this, you'll need to load the library "RColorBrewer" (it has already been installed for your convenience). You should install directly in the Console, but load the library _in the code chunk_. At the bottom of this RMarkdown document, you can see the colorblind-friendly palettes from Brewer. 
    


5. Modify the _size_ of the output figure in "chunk-4" by adding parameters like `{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}` until you find a width/height that conveys your figure well.


    **At this point, if you haven't already, Knit the whole document to see how your chunks appear!**
 
 
## Working with global options

<br><br>

#### <mark> EXERCISE SET TWO </mark>

Modify the YAML frontmatter and the R `setup` chunk to customize this document as your own. The `setup` chunk is a standard part of RMarkdown documents used to set __global options__ (i.e., applies to whole document) and values used throughout the entire document. 


**After each step, KNIT the document to confirm it worked.**


1. Working with YAML frontmatter 
    + Modify the YAML frontmatter "author" field to show YOUR name, not mine!
    + Add a _new_ field to the YAML frontmatter called "date". This should be a top-level field similar to title and author (unlike, for example, the highlight field which is nested under output/html_document). In this field, type today's date in any format you like (words, numbers, whatever - as long as it is in quotes)!
    + Change the value in the new "date" field to this exact text, including the quotes: "`r Sys.Date()`". This will automatically calculate and reveal today's date.
    + Modify the "highlight" field to a different [syntax highlighter](
  https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/pandoc-syntax-highlighting-examples/), and re-Knit. 
  All you need to do is delete the word "tango" and replace it with your choice, such as "espresso". _Ignore any directions this website provides - the point of the link is just to see the palettes._ Choose your own adventure!!
  
<br><br>

2. Working with the `setup` R chunk. 

    We'll start working with the line `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)`, which sets the global options for how the `knitr` package should treat code chunks. Here, it says that all code chunks should have `echo=TRUE`, i.e. output should never be suppressed. We can continue to add arguments to this global setup:

  **Again, after each step, KNIT the document to confirm it worked.**


   + Modify this line to read `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)` and re-knit. How has the document changed?
   + Revert back to `echo=TRUE`, but add an additional argument `eval=FALSE` as:`knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE).=`. **Before knitting**, make an educated guess for how the document will change. Then knit and see!
   + Remove the `eval=FALSE` argument, and add different arguments to change the size of ALL FIGURES that the document makes. Set the global figure width to 3 and the global figure height to 4 (Hint: we did this already in Exercise Set One!)
   + It is usually in the setup chunk where we load all libraries that our code will rely on. You'll see that `tidyverse` is currently the only library loaded. Add another line into the setup chunk that also loads the library `RColorBrewer` (this has already been installed for your convenience).
