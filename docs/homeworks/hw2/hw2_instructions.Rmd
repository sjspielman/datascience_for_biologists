```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

> For this homework, you will be writing your very first _RMarkdown file_ and practicing your base R skills. 

## Instructions

+ Obtain the homework from your RStudio Cloud class project by running the following code in the R Console:

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  library(ds4b.materials) # Load the class library
  launch_homework(2)      # Launch Homework 2
  ```

+ Answer each question with appropriate code and comments in the given question's R chunk. Chunks are _named_ as `q1` for question 1, `q2` for question 2, etc.
  + Always ensure your answers are being produced by code. No credit will be given for answers that are not directly produced by code. Please refer to the examples at the bottom of these instructions for examples of acceptable and unacceptable code.
  + You should have one comment per line of code. Comments should be written in "plain english" and give _brief descriptions_ about what the code is doing. Comments should be written _above_ the line of code they refer to. You will not be graded on whether I think your comment is "good enough" - your comments need only be "good enough" for YOU to understand what your code is doing.
<br><br>
+ You must set an _RMarkdown theme and code syntax highlighting scheme_ of your choosing in the YAML front matter. These links will help you:
  + Choose your favorite _theme_ among the **pre-packaged themes** (ignore everything below "Even More Themes") shown at [this link](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)
  + Choose your favorite _syntax highlighting_ among these options at [this link](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/pandoc-syntax-highlighting-examples/)
<br><br>
+ [**Don't forget to watch these short videos as resources for navigating/customizing RStudio, writing RMarkdown documents, and using the `introverse`!**](https://sjspielman.github.io/datascience_for_biologists/video_links.html)


## Homework Questions


1. Define two variables `a` and `b` as values 8 and 64, respectively. Use a logical operator and the function `sqrt()` to ask if `a` is equal to the square root of `b`, and print the output. **The code should print `TRUE` if they are equal and `FALSE` if not.**
    + Need help? Run `get_help("logical")` and `get_help("sqrt")` in the R Console after loading the `introverse` library.

<br> 

2. Define a variable `success_status` whose values *depend* on a logical comparison, using variables `a` and `b` from the previous question. If `a` squared equals `b`, `success_status` should be defined with the value "eureka". Otherwise, if `a` squared does not equal `b`, `success_status` should be defined with the value "wompwomp". **Print the value of `success_status` after it is defined.**
      + Need help? Run `get_help("ifelse")` in the R Console after loading the `introverse` library.
      + Do NOT redefine the `a` and `b` variables. You defined them in question #2, and you are still coding in the same Rmarkdown file. _We always want to avoid repeating code since it often leads to unexpected bugs._

<br> 

3. Define an array variable called `mammals_vector` to contain these strings: "camel", "civet", "mink", "bat", "ferret", and "pangolin" (these are all mammals known to be vectors for either SARS-CoV-2 or one of its close relatives SARS and MERS).  Use the logical operator `%in%` to determine if the string "elephant" is in the array. **If "elephant" is in the array, your code should print `TRUE`, and `FALSE` otherwise.**
    + Need help? Run `get_help("logical")` in the R Console after loading the `introverse` library.

<br>

4. Define an array variable called `dinosaurs` to contain three strings: "eagle", "ostrich", and "sparrow" (wait, those are all birds?! That's right, birds are dinosaurs!). Then, define two other variables called `mammals_length` and `dinosaurs_length`. The variable `mammals_length` should be defined as the result of running `length()` on the `mammals_vector` array you defined in the previous question. The variable `dinosaurs_length` should similar be defined as the result of running `length()` on the `dinosaurs` array. Finally, use a logical operator to compare these variables. **If `mammals_length` is larger than `dinosaurs_length` (in other words, the mammals array is longer than the dinosaurs array), your code should print `TRUE`. Otherwise, your code should print `FALSE`.**
    + Need help? Run `get_help("length")` in the R Console after loading the `introverse` library.
    + Make sure to have variables dynamically assigned with `length()`! Scroll to the bottom of these instructions to see what I mean by making sure code produces the length variables!

<br> 

5. Use the `nchar()` function to determine how many characters are in each string in the `dinosaurs` array, and save the result of this operation to a variable `nchar_dinosaurs`. Then, use a logical operator to ask if each value is equal to 7. **Your code should print a new array containing `TRUE` or `FALSE` values representing whether this condition was met for each value.**
    + Need help? Run `get_help("nchar")` in the R Console after loading the `introverse` library.


<br> 

6. Use a colon (`:`) to create a variable called `q6` as an array of numbers in order -12 through 17. From this variable `q6`, calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, and sum (with functions `mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`,and `sum()`, respectively) of this array. Each calculation should be saved to a variable called, respectively: `q6_mean`, `q6_median`, `q6_sd`, and `q6_sum`. **Finally, print these four variables. You do not need to print `q6`.**
    + Need help? Run `get_help("mean")` in the R Console after loading the `introverse` library.

<br> 

7. Again consider the array `q6`. Use a logical operator to ask if all values in this array are less than or 0 (aka, is `q6` less than or equal to 0?). The result of this code will be an array itself containing `TRUE` and `FALSE` values corresponding to whether the $\leq0$ condition was met for each value in `q6`.  Save this resulting array to a variable called `q6_leq0` ("leq" = "**l**ess than or **eq**ual to"), and **print the value of `q6_leq0`.**
    + Need help? Run `get_help("logical")` in the R Console after loading the `introverse` library.

<br> 


8. Teach yourself how to use the function `all()` using the `introverse` help docs, by running `get_help("all")` in the R Console, after you've loaded the `introverse` library. Then, use this function to determine whether all values of `q6` are _less than or equal to 0._ **Your code should print a _single_ `TRUE` if all values are less than or equal to 0, and a single `FALSE` otherwise.**
    + Hint: The code is _almost exactly identical_ to the code for question 7!
    
<br> 

9. Again consider the array `q6`. For this question, find the _sum_ of the _absolute values_ of this array. To achieve this, you will need to first get the absolute value of the array `q6` (using the `abs()` function), and then you will need to sum those values (using the `sum()` function). **Your code chunk should reveal the final sum.**
    + Need help? Run `get_help("sum")` or `get_help("abs")` in the R Console after loading the `introverse` library.
    + Hint: You can approach this question in several ways, as long as you use `abs()` and then `sum()` on `q6` in that order.
  

<br> 


10. There is a super useful function called `paste()` that allows you to combine strings (characters) together to create a new string. See how this function works below:

      ```{r paste_demo}
      # combine the three strings "string 1", "and", and "string 2" into ONE string
      combined_string <- paste("string 1", "and", "string 2")
      
      # reveal value
      combined_string
      ```
      
      ```{r paste_demo2}
      # you can also include variables:
      a_string <- "hello there"
      combined_string2 <- paste("string 1", a_string, "string 2")
      
      # reveal value
      combined_string2
      ```
      
      ```{r paste_demo3}
      # Let's use paste() to directly write a sentence (HINT!!)
      # (don't worry about having a period at the end of sentence!)
      variable_value <- 10
      paste("The value of the variable is", variable_value)
      ```      

    **Use the `paste()` function and the variable `q6_mean` you previously defined to print a sentence that says: "The mean of q6 is ...." where .... is the the `q6_mean` value.** Your code should _NOT_ include a number directly (don't copy/paste the value of the mean). You may _ONLY_ refer to this number value with the `q6_mean` variable.
        
      + Need help? Run `get_help("paste")` in the R Console after loading the `introverse` library.

<br>


11. For the remaining questions, you will consider the built-in R dataset `iris`, a famous dataset with 150 rows and 5 columns that provides physical measurements for 150 iris (a type of flowering plant) specimens from three different species.

    For this question, write _code_ to determine the following information about `iris`. You need to use a single function for each task (there will be four lines of code in the end), and all output should be printed from the chunk.

    + The number of rows (using `nrow()`)
    + The number of columns  (using `ncol()`)
    + The _names_ of the columns (using `names()`)
    + A _summary_ of the distribution of each column in the data (using `summary()`)


<br>

12. The goal of this question is to answer, "do sepal lengths or petal lengths have more variation?" When comparing variation across _different variables_, we can calculate the _coefficient of variation (COV) which is simply _the standard deviation divided by the mean_. Calculate the COV for sepal lengths and petal lengths, and save to variables `cov_sepal_length` and `cov_petal_length`, respectively. Then, use a logical operator to ask whether sepal lengths have _more_ (`>`) variation than petal lengths. **Your code should print `TRUE` if sepal lengths have more spread, and `FALSE` otherwise.**

<br>

13. Calculate the mean petal width and save the result to a variable `mean_petal_width`. Then, use `paste()` to print a sentence that reads: `"The mean petal width in the iris dataset is ..."`, where `...` is replaced with the value in `mean_petal_width`. Again, make sure your code is only using _variables_ and not values directly.

<br>

14. The `iris` variable `Species` is a _factor variable_, meaning R recognizes it as containing _categories_. R refers to factor categories with the term *levels*. By contrast, the variable `Sepal.Width` is numeric, not a factor, so R doesn't recognize that it has categories (which is reasonable! it's numeric!). The R function `levels()` can be used to quickly see the categories (levels!) in a factor variable. For this question, practice using the `levels()` by running it twice: on the `Species` column and on the `Sepal.Width` column.  **Your code should simply print the result of running the `levels()` function on those two columns.**
    + Hint: The code output will be consistent with whether the variables are factors. _Non-factor variables don't have any levels and the code result will reflect this._

<br>

15. To learn a little more about factors, let's _coerce_ some columns into and away from factors. To do this, we'll create a new dataset called `iris2` containing some coerced columns. Copy and paste the following code into the R chunk for this question (this code should be the first code in your answer!!). This code creates a new data frame `iris2` that contains the same information as `iris`, but `Species` is no longer factor (it is now character), and `Sepal.Width` is no longer numeric (it is now a factor).

    ```{r eval=F}
    # Create a copy of iris in iris2
    iris2 <- iris
    
    # Coerce Species into a character. Previously, it was a factor.
    iris2$Species <- as.character(iris2$Species)
    
    # Coerce Sepal.Width into a factor. Previously, it was numeric.
    iris2$Sepal.Width <- as.factor(iris2$Sepal.Width)
    ```
    
    Again write code with `levels()` to see the categories in the **`iris2`** columns `Species` and `Sepal.Width`, and notice (on your own - no need to write anything) how the output differs. Finally, write two more line of code in this chunk to **calculate the mean of the `Sepal.Width` column in `iris` AND in `iris2`**, which should also be printed out. In ~1 sentence of written text _below the code chunk_, explain why _IN YOUR OWN WORDS_ this calculation didn't work as well as you might have hoped (hint: the output from `levels()` is informative!).

## What NOT to do vs what TO do

> The following code chunks provide examples of how *NOT TO* and how *TO* answer a hypothetical homework question using code. Notice how there are many ways to correctly achieve the right result! Welcome to coding :)

**Hypothetical homework question: What is the length of an array with values 4, 6, and 10?**

<br>

**NO!** This code is not acceptable, largely because it is not code - it is just the number 3. There is no code used at all to answer the question. Even if it is "easy" to do something in your head, you must use code to answer it. *It also will not produce any output from a script since it is not formally printed.*
```{r}
3
```

<br><br>
**NO!** This code is not acceptable, because even though code was used at some point, the code itself does not directly produce the output. This example represents a situation where you might run `length(c(4,6,10))` in the R Console, or run `length(c(4,6,10))` in the chunk but later delete or comment it out. You might look at the output and say, "the code calculated 3, so the answer is 3." But, this is not ok, since the code itself must reveal the number 3.

```{r}
#length(c(4,6,10))
3
```

<br><br>
**NO!** This is getting much closer, since we now have the full code needed to generate the output. However, nothing is actually printed, so the output is not revealed. _It is critical to always reveal the output!_
```{r}
answer <- length(c(4,6,10))
```


<br><br>
**YES!** This "fixes" the previous "NO!" example by revealing the output.
```{r}
answer <- length(c(4,6,10))
answer
```
<br><br>
**YES!** Only code is used to produce the output.
```{r}
# YES!
length(c(4,6,10)) 
```

<br><br>
**YES!** Only code is used to produce the output. This strategy uses improved coding style by defining a _variable_ for the array, and then using `length()` to calculate the length of the variable.
```{r}
# YES!
my_array <- c(4,6,10)
length(my_array)
```
<br><br>
**YES!** Only code is used to produce the output. This strategy uses improved coding style by defining a _variable_ for the array, and then defining another variable to contain the output from the `length()` calculation.
```{r}
# YES!
my_array <- c(4,6,10)
the_length <- length(my_array)
the_length
```
<br>
**Unless the instructions explicitly ask you to define certain variables, all "YES!" code versions here are equivalent and entirely accceptable!**
