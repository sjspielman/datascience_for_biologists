# Summary statistics: From many values to _one value_

```{r, collapse=T}
# Get 20 random numbers from 1-1000
x <- sample(1:1000, 20)
length(x)
x
```


```{r, collapse=T}
mean(x)
median(x)
min(x)
max(x)
sd(x)
sum(x)
```


---


# These functions do not _summarize_

> The operation is performed separately on each value in `x`

```{r, collapse=T}
x
```

```{r, collapse=T}
sqrt(x)

log(x, 10) # log in base 10!

exp(x) # e^x

abs(x) # absolute value. kinda boring here, all numbers are positive
```

# The `dplyr` function `summarize()`

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price))
```

---

# The `dplyr` function `summarize()`

> It is NOT AT ALL the same as `mutate()`!!


```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds %>%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price))
```


```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds %>%
  mutate(mean_price = mean(price))
```


---

# Don't forget to name the column!

> Otherwise, it's going to be _really annoying_ to work with

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  # Works, but ends up gnarly
  summarize(mean(price))
```


### When column names contain characters like parentheses, spaces, or other weirdness, you're gonna have a bad time. 

---

# More comparison with `mutate()`


> `sqrt()` is not a summary function! 

.pull-left[
```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds %>%
  mutate(price_sqrt = sqrt(price)) %>%
  # so we can see in the slides:
  select(price_sqrt, everything())
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds %>%
  summarize(price_sqrt = sqrt(price))
```
]

### The lesson: `summarize()` will get rid of any columns that are not used in the calculation.

# Working with grouped data

```{r, collapse=T}
head(diamonds, 3) # show first three rows only, to fit on slides
```

```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) #<<
```

---

# Working with grouped data

#### `cut` is the **grouping variable**

```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  # Perform calculation for each group separately
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price))
```

### Notice how `cut` is retained in the output - the grouping variable was used in the summary calculation.
---


# Working with grouped data

#### `cut` AND `color` are the **grouping variables**

```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut, color) %>%
  # Perform calculation for each group separately
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price))
```


Note: `## 'summarise()' regrouping output by 'cut' (override with '.groups' argument)` is just a message that the output has been ordered by `cut`.
---

# How would we plot this data?

```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price)) -> diamond_mean_prices

diamond_mean_prices
```

---

# A barplot is a good choice:

We want `cut` on the X-axis and `mean_price` on the Y-axis. Each bar's height should be the mean price of the diamond cut.

--

```{r, error=T, fig.height = 0.5, fig.width = 0.5}
ggplot(diamond_mean_prices, 
       aes(x = cut,
           y = mean_price)) +
  geom_bar()
```

### UH-OH! This code gave an error! 

---

# Let's try again

`geom_bar()` **automatically determines the Y-axis as the COUNT**. So, we shouldn't provide a y-axis when using this geom.


--

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(diamond_mean_prices, 
       aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar()
```

### No more error, but this code isn't doing what _we want_ it to do. The computer only knows what you tell it - not what you _want to tell it._
---

# What happened?

### The only way to figure out what happened is to _look at the data_

```{r}
diamond_mean_prices
```

```{r, echo=F, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(diamond_mean_prices, 
       aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

# Introducing `geom_col()`



```{r}
ggplot(diamond_mean_prices, 
       aes(x = cut,
           y = mean_price)) + #<<
  geom_col() #<<
```

### Use `geom_col()` when you want to _literally plot a VARIABLE_ (not a count!) on the y-axis 

---

# Do we remember `fct_relevel()` ???

```{r}
cut_order <- c("Ideal", "Premium", "Very Good", "Good", "Fair")
ggplot(diamond_mean_prices, 
       aes(x = fct_relevel(cut, cut_order),#<<
           y = mean_price)) + 
  geom_col() 
```

---

# Introducting `fct_reorder()`

```{r}
ggplot(diamond_mean_prices, 
       aes(x = fct_reorder(cut, mean_price),#<<
           y = mean_price)) + 
  geom_col() 
```

### Automatically reorder a factor _based on values of another variable_. Magic.

---

# Introducting `fct_reorder()`

```{r}
ggplot(diamond_mean_prices, 
       aes(x = fct_reorder(cut, mean_price),#<<
           y = mean_price)) + 
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Diamond cut")
```

---

# Introducting `fct_reorder()`

```{r, fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot(diamond_mean_prices, 
       aes(x = fct_reorder(cut, mean_price, .desc=TRUE),#<<
           y = mean_price)) + 
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Diamond cut")
```

### Use the `fct_reorder()` argument `.desc=TRUE` for descending order

---

# Helpful `dplyr` functions for summarizing and/or grouping

+ `ungroup()`: Remove groupings from data. No arguments needed
  + If grouping is not the last step in your pipeline, ALWAYS ALWAYS **ALWAYS** 
<br><br>
+ `tally()`: Count all observations in a group
<br><br>
+ `n()`: Acts as a _variable_ indicating the number of observations in a group
<br><br>
+ `count()`: Super handy shortcut for `group_by()` %>% `tally()` %>% `ungroup()`

---

# Don't ever forget to `ungroup()`

```{r, collapse=T, message=F}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut, color) %>%
  summarize(median_x = median(x)) %>%
  ungroup() #<<
```

### _This is absolutely critical. Build the habit now, even if it sometimes seems silly._

---

# Ungrouping matters

```{r, echo=F, include=F}
set.seed(10)
diamonds %>%
  mutate(expensive = ifelse(price >=10000, "yes", "no")) %>%
  select(expensive, price, carat) %>%
  group_by(expensive) %>%
  sample_n(2) %>%
  ungroup() -> diamonds_tiny
```

```{r}
diamonds_tiny
```

---

# Ungrouping matters

```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds_tiny %>%
  group_by(expensive) %>%
  mutate(mean_price = mean(price)) %>%
  mutate(mean_carat = mean(carat))
```

```{r, collapse=T}
diamonds_tiny %>%
  group_by(expensive) %>%
  mutate(mean_price = mean(price)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% #<<
  mutate(mean_carat = mean(carat))
```

---

# Neither of those versions is "right" or "wrong" 

### Instead, it depends which calculation you actually wanted to calculate!

---

# Count observations (rows) with `tally()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
# No grouping - counts all rows
diamonds %>%
  tally()

diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  tally() %>%
  ungroup()
```
]


.pull-right[
```{r}
# Change `n` with argument "name"
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  tally(name = "count_cut") %>%
  ungroup()
```

**`tally()` returns a tibble with a column (named `n` by default) representing the number of rows**

]




---

# Magically count with `count()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  tally() %>%
  ungroup()
```

**`count()` is a handy shortcut that groups, tallies, and ungroups for you!** 
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
diamonds %>%
  count(cut)

diamonds %>%
  count(cut, color)
```
]

---

# We can use `count()` just like `tally()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
diamonds %>%
  count(cut, color)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
diamonds %>%
  count(cut, color, 
        name = "count_cut_color")
```
]
